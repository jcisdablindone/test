                <strong>Job Loacation : Bargoed</strong> <br /><br /> 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is with great pleasure I provide this letter of recommendation to Chris Thomas Roofing Contractors and their owner Chris Thomas. Further to contacting Chris and four other roofing contractors for an estimate on my property which I knew was going to be a considerable project I found Chris polite, approachable and pleasant to deal with . On receiving an estimate from him I was also assured that the work would be carefully planned to &nbsp;enable my family and I to live at the property with minimum disruption to our busy daily lives. I was also provided with a complete break down of the material and labour costs all of which would come with a ten year guarantee.<br />
                <br />
                Throughout the course of the work taking place I found Mr Thomas a consummate professional. He was accurate with his initial assessment and estimate whilst also providing unprompted updates on a frequent basis as the job progressed.<br />
                <br />
                In addition Chris and his team kept the workplace clean and tidy not leaving it in disarray overnight or during the weekend.
                <br />
                My wife and I were anxious not to make a mistake with our choice of tradesmen but were more than pleased with our end result and would certainly recommend Mr Thomas to any prospective customers in the future.<br />
                <br />
                Yours sincerely,<br />
                J.Doubler&nbsp;
